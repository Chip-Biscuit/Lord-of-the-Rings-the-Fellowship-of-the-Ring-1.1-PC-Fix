# Requirements before using fix
Before using the fix for it to work properly you must have patched the game up to 1.1 release. **This fix WILL NOT WORK on a 1.0 version** of the game and 1.0 is not supported. If you have not updated your Fellowship of the Ring to 1.1 already then you can download the patch from here - https://www.gamepressure.com/download/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-v11-us-patch/z178b 

If you have trouble with updating your copy of Fellowship of the Ring to 1.1 with the patch, then join the **Discord** below for help regarding this issue.

**IT IS VERY IMPORTANT YOU READ THE READ ME FILE IN THE DOWNLOADED FILES FOR THIS TO WORK PROPERLY!**

# Instructions
Go to release, download the zip file and extract it, then put the d3d8.dll, d3d8.ini, fellowship.dll, fellowship.ini, fellowship.rfl, levellist.txt and FellowshipPatcher.exe into your game folder next to the fellowship.exe file.

Before editing the settings in the ini files and starting up the game run FellowshipPatcher.exe once so that it can patch the game to fix the Black Screen issue on startup. Then you are good to go! You can edit the settings you wish to use in the d3d8.ini and fellowship.ini files.

# Aspect Ratio
You can choose the Aspect Ratio you wish to use in the d3d8.ini file from the setting fullscreenaspectratio. All aspect ratios that are supported in the fix are listed here, use the number next to the one you wish to use. This will unlock all the resolutions for that specific aspect ratio within the games graphics settings, where you can select the resolution you wish to use.

This automatically calculates FOV in the game based on the aspect ratio that you chose in the d3d8.ini file.

# FPS
Default for FPS is 60 which you can change in the fellowship.ini file. The game functions on higher fps without too many issues, however, uncapped is not advised.

It is best to leave the option for FPSAnimations alone as this can easily break the game in multiple areas and the option only exists for experimentation in gameplay.

# Cheats/Extras
To use the cheats when in gameplay simply press the options listed below:

F5 - fly -> Fly

F6 - drop -> Drop

F7 - tim -> Invincible

F8 - tele -> Teleport

F9 - mrclean -> MrClean

F10 - heal -> Full Health

F11 - bye -> Suicide

F12 - invisowalls -> Show Invisible Statics

On clicking New Game, you shall now have access right away to all the levels within the game. Simply select a level you wish to play or the first level in you wish to start from the beginning of the game like normal.
